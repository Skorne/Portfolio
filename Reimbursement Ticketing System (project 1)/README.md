# Revature Training  Project 1

## Project Description
This project is an expense reimbursement ticketing system that handles reimbursing employees for expenses incurred while on company time. Employees can login and submit tickets for reimbursements.  Those with manager type accounts will be able to go into the system and approve or deny these requests. 

## Technologies Used

 - Java v8
 - JDBC 
 - PostgreSQL
 - Javalin
 - JavaScript
 - HTML 5
 - CSS

## Features

 - Employees can submit tickets using a Client application on the front end
 - Financial managers can login and approve/deny tickets
 - The site will persist the data related to those tickets in a PostgreSQL database

To-Do:

 - Add more styling to the front end 
 - Add in real bank functionality if possible

## Getting started
To run the project, open the folder that contains the git repo in your IDE, then run the main to start the server. 
The database used to store user and ticket information has been taken down, so site, unfortunately, can no longer be used.
