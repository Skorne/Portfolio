	got the post dao updated for spring, and will be doing the same for user model and doa tonight
Christian:
	update: I worked on the wrong thing last night as chris knows, 
	I will be getting back on task to implement creating a post in the front end tonight.
nick:
	 I made a navbar in the register page last night.
	if the back end is set up enough by now I can start on hooking up a CreateUser api post method so that i can actually use my form to actually create a user
